<b>About:</b>
</p>

Do you want to know the remaining battery capacity of your smartphone or tablet, or have you bought a new battery and want to check its capacity? Then this app is for you! Capacity Info can help you find out the remaining capacity of the battery or the actual capacity of a new battery. Also, using this application, you can find out the number of charging cycles, the temperature and voltage of the battery, find out the charging/discharging current, receive notifications when the battery is discharged (charge level is adjustable), when the battery is charged to a certain level of charge, when the battery is fully charged (Status "Charged"). Also, with the help of this application you can receive notifications of overheating/overcooling of the battery, as well as with this application you can find out the charging current limit (it is not always possible to get the charging current limit data). It is also possible to display values ​​in an overlay.

P.S This application consumes <b>very little</b> energy in the background. The wakelock, which is in the application, is used <b>only</b> during charging, it is needed for the charging time (without it, Android "puts the application to sleep" after ~40 seconds for a while, so without it, the charging time will <b>be incorrect</b>). Therefore, using this application, you will not notice the loss of autonomy. The application is completely free and without ads, and will remain so forever.

<b>Application Features:</b><br/>
• Battery wear;<br/>
• Residual capacity;<br/>
• Added capacity during charging;<br/>
• Current capacity;<br/>
• Battery Level (%);<br/>
• Charging status;<br/>
• Charging/discharging current;<br/>
• Maximum, average and minimum charging/discharging current;<br/>
• Battery temperature;<br/>
• Battery voltage;<br/>
• The number of cycles;<br/>
• Number of charges;<br/>
• Battery condition;<br/>
• Time of the last charge;<br/>
• Battery technology;<br/>
• Notification of a full charge, a certain level (%) of a charge, a certain level (%) of discharge, charging current, overheating and overcooling;<br/>
• Resetting the number of charges;<br/>
• Zeroing the number of cycles;<br/>
• Overlay;<br/>
• Light and dark theme;<br/>
• Theme depending on the system theme (Android 10+);<br/>

<b>Explanations of required permissions:</b><br/>
• Access to device memory - needed to back up settings;<br/>
• Wakelock - needed to ensure that the OS does not "lull" the application during charging, for the correct charging time;<br/>
• On top of all windows - needed for overlay;<br/>
• Launch after boot - needed so that the application starts itself after loading the OS.

<b>Attention!</b> Before leaving a review or asking a question, read the instructions and follow them, as well as read the FAQ.

<b>Instruction:</b>
</p>

1.In order for the application to show the remaining capacity, put the device on charge, while the service must be turned on.<br/>
2.For a more accurate display of the remaining capacity, charge the device fully until "Status: Charged" is displayed. <br/>
3.If charging occurs after reaching 100%, then this is normal. Modern devices continue to charge for some time after reaching 100%. <br/>
4.If the design capacity is incorrect, change it in the application settings.<br/>
5.If the current capacity and/or charge/discharge current and/or voltage is not displayed correctly, then change the unit in the application settings.

<b>ATTENTION!</b> Do not kill the service. If the shell of your device likes to "kill" applications, or completely "kills" applications when cleaning the most recently launched applications or when removing an application from the most recently launched applications, or you use power saving, add this application to all possible exceptions. If your firmware has an application startup setting, be sure to ensure that this application can start after loading the OS, if you want the application to start automatically after loading the OS. If you don't know what and where to configure so that the application is not "killed" by the system, use the "Don't kill my app!" Service by choosing the manufacturer of your device.

<b>ATTENTION!</b> On Huawei & Honor, the current capacity may not display correctly. Unfortunately nothing can be done about it

<b>FAQ:</b>
</p>

Question: How does the app work?<br/>
Answer: Residual capacity is formed on the basis of the current capacity upon reaching 100% and the status of "Charged". The current capacity is taken from the kernel of the OS, by the Android API itself, which allows you to get the current capacity without root rights. The kernel takes the current capacity from the battery itself and writes it to the "charge_counter" file (file path: /sys/class/power_supply/battery). On how accurate the current capacity depends on the battery and the core itself.

Question: What is considered to be "Capacity Added"?<br/>
Answer: "Capacity Added" is considered very simple: the current capacity - capacity, which was before you connected the charging.

Question: Where does the application get the "Charging Current Limit"?<br/>
Answer: The application takes the "Charging Current Limit" from the kernel file "constant_charge_current_max" along the path /sys/class/power_supply/battery.

Question: Why is "Charging Current Limit" not displayed?<br/>
Answer: The display "Charging Current Limit" depends on whether the file "constant_charge_current_max" is readable or not. Not all kernels allow "reading" this file, and also not all kernels have this file.

Question: I have everything (or almost everything) in zeros. Why?<br/>
Answer: Because the manufacturer of your device has saved on various sensors.  And since the kernel cannot get the value, it returns 0.

Question: Very large or small numbers are shown in the current capacity, charge/discharge current, voltage.<br/>
Answer: Go to the settings, in the "Misc" section, expand all the settings and change the unit of measurement.

Question: The current capacity has ceased to be displayed, although it was previously displayed (or is displayed, but not always).<br/>
Answer: This means that the battery is coming or has already come to an end. If everything is in order with the battery, then the firmware kernel or the controller, which gives the current capacity, may be buggy.

Question: The device is not supported. Add device support.<br/>
Answer: Alas, this is impossible, since it depends primarily on the battery and secondarily on the OS kernel. Therefore, setting 1 and writing about what is not supported, as well as asking to add support for a device, is pointless. You can bet 1, but think about it three times: is it worth spoiling the average rating for the application due to the fact that your battery or core does not give up the current capacity?
